# Tanks!

A game like no other.

**This game is not yet operational**

## The premise

This is a simple game in which you have a tank, and you have to kill everybody. The idea of the game is that you have to write a C++ class, which will control the tank.

### How to write your own bot

First fork the repository. Then clone it to your machine. Open the program in either Visual Studio in Windows, or any sane editor in Linux. Add your bot in `src/AwesomeBot/AwesomeBot.cpp` and `src/AwesomeBot/AwesomeBot.cpp`. You can copy the SimpleBot as an example. **Please use a separate C++ namespace for your bot**

## Tournament

There will be an online tournament of the created bots.

### How to participate

To participate in the tournament your code have to be made according to some rules:
- Cannot base on any modification of the main code
- Have to be placed in the directory `src/name/` where `name` is your GitHub login
- All things written have to be done in a separate namespace `name` (the same GitHub login)
- Your Bot code cannot use SFML library or any external input

After your code is made in accordence with the rules, just open a pull request to this repository.

### Hacking

Yes. We know you can hack this tournament in 666 ways. Yeah. Good for you. If you want to hack something, hack Putin's girlfriend instagram account. See how it goes. This game is to have fun creating *AI for a Funkin' Tank*, not to deal with wannabe hackers making fork bombs.
